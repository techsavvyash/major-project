## Ideas
- Research around batch sizes and figuring out where we get the max throughput based on batch sizes. -- refer async batch processing paper
	- can correlate batch size to eventual consistency in the algorithm
- implement raft using SIMD -- single instruction multiple data -- single instruction multiple data in CPU -- JSON Parsing 
- JSON.stringify() -- make this fast as well
- Proto-Buffers -- comparision between json and proto-bufs
- parallel processing
-
